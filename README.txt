CMYK

These examples demonstrates the use of slightly modified 
Processing PGraphicsPDF class which permits, among a few other things, 
to set colors in CMYK space.
This class was used used at a Resonate.io workshop in Belgrade, 2013

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose

The actual Processing PDF library permits to create PDF documents 
with the familiar Processing graphics API. 
The library includes the iText Open Source Library for Java but does not 
expose all of itâ€™s functionalities. 
The purpose of the custom PDF class is to give access to some useful functions
(by breaking the seamless integration in Processing).
The library is now just a visible Processing class which allows eventual 
implementation of further functions.
Use at own risk.

1. cmyk

overprint preview.

2. preview
An example which shows how to preview the graphics on display 
in RGB color space before creating the PDF output.

3. template
This example loads an existing PDF file and uses it as a template.
